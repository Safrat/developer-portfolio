                <p id="tumi">Here is an question arrived.The main question is why you have to be web developer.The
                    answer is
                    if you
                    become a web developer then you can get job remotely and you can work from anywhere like from
                    Australia,
                    sitting front of a window in Greece with a cup of tea or somewhere you want to belong. You can
                    travel
                    and earn maoney by doing your dream job. </p>
